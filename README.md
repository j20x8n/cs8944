WR   1: College Writing
Fall 2024
COURSE   DESCRIPTION:
Concentrating on analysis and interpretation, Writing   1 prepares   students   for   the   requirements   and   expectations of writing in other college courses, introduces   students to   critical   reading,   and   emphasizes writing as a part of the thinking process.   Through   completing   informal   and formal   assignments,   students   develop   ideas, summarize and analyze content, and learn   to   form   arguments   and written   responses   in   a   clear, logical, and   convincing   manner.
Furthermore, teamwork   is critical   in our class. Students will collaborate with one   another   to   analyze cultural texts and to articulate how they   make   meaning. Working together,   students will   gain   the   ability   to interpret   books, social   media behaviors, and even product   packaging within   an   overarching framework   of   cultural analysis.   By analyzing a variety of texts and exploring the ways   in   which   all   texts   comment   upon      larger concerns   in American society, students will build important   critical thinking   and   communication skills.

REQUIRED   MATERIALS:
All   in-class assignments will   be written   in dark blue or black   ink   and   then, when   required,   submitted   to   Canvas   in   PDF or   jpeg form,   if you are writing   by   hand.

All out-of-class assignments should be typed in   black font   and   submitted through   Canvas.
In terms of technology, since you will   be asked to check   Canvas and   your   official   IVC   email   address   for   correspondence, announcements, and assignments, you will need steady   and   reliable   internet   service,   and a   laptop/computer,   preferably with a working webcam and   microphone.

COURSE   REQUIREMENTS
1.      Four   Formal Writing   Projects (Essays)
To   pass this course,   completion of two out-of-class writing projects, two   in-class   essays,   two   high-stakes   in-person group   presentations, and   numerous   homework assignments and discussion board   posts   are            required. The   in-class essays will   be written   by   hand,   in   pen, and on green   books.   Be aware   that   laptop      usage   is   prohibited during the   in-class essays. The out-of-class writing projects   are   due   on the pre-specified date at   11:59   PM   PST. To compose each out-   of-class writing   project,   students will write   a rough draft,   perform. and obtain   peer reviews, and complete   a final   draft.   The   final   draft   and   rough   draft   will be submitted on Canvas, and these   assignments will   be   conditionally   released,   meaning   that   students   must submit a   rough draft   in order to submit a final   draft   that   earns   points.   The   peer   response   sheets will be completed   in class or on Canvas.   Make sure to   submit   the   rough   draft   on   time,   since   Canvas   only   assigns   peer reviews to students who complete the rough   draft.   Every   24   hour   period   that   the final   draft   of   each essay   is   late on Canvas   incurs a   10%   penalty. This   means that   the   minute   it   is   late,   it   incurs   a   10%            penalty, and after 24   hours,   it   incurs another   10%   penalty.   Failure to turn   in the   paper will   result   in   receiving 0   points.   Every out-of-class essay   must   be scanned through Turn   it   in to   receive   a   grade.   If an   essay   is submitted   in a format that Turnitin cannot   read, then the   essay will   earn   0   points.   Departmental   guidelines disallow students from turning in work written for other classes.   Each   paper submitted   must   be   written specifically for this semester’s WR   1 course to earn   points.
GOOGLEDOC   POLICY:   Because   I will   be using your individualized writing data to assist   you with   your   writing   process, all out-of-class essays must be written   in   and   submitted   through   google   docs,   and   the googledoc   must document the student’s writing process from the absolute   beginning to   the   end.   In   other   words,   please do   not copy and   paste an essay   into googledocs,   as   doing   so will   incur   a   30%   penalty.   In order to earn full credit,   please   provide complete transparency   in terms   of   keystroke   data   by   beginning and finishing your essay on the same googledoc.   Essays that   do   not   meet   the   stated googledoc requirements will lose 30%   of the final   essay   grade.
All essays   must   include a Works Cited   page, and this works   cited   page   is   not   counted   in the   minimum page requirement for the essay.   If an essay   is   missing a Works Cited   page,   it   loses   10%   of the   essay   grade. Out-of-class essays will   include the Works Cited   page at the   end   of the   essay,   and for the   in-class   essays, students will   prepare them for submission beforehand, and   I will collect   them   on   the   in-class   essay date.In order to   be accepted, the final draft and   rough draft   of   every   project   must   be   typed   in   12   pt.   Times   New      Roman   Font and double-spaced with one   inch   margins.   Projects   must also adhere to   MLA format.   Papers   that do   not adhere to   MLA format will   lose   3   percentage   points.
2.   PROJECT   PRESENTATIONS: You will   participate   in two group   in-class   presentations. You   must   be   present and   participate on the day your group presents   in   order to   earn   credit for   these   assignments.3.   READINGS AND   HOMEWORK: One of the   main goals of this course   is to   help you   become   a   better   reader because strong   reading skills lead   to   strong writing   skills.   All   readings   will   help   you   to   gain   ideas   for your writing assignments, allow you to view various writing techniques and styles,   and   deepen   your      understanding of the writing process.
Most weeks, you will   be assigned between three and six texts   to   read. Additionally,   you   will   be   asked   to   代 写WR 1: College Writing Fall 2024Python
代做程序编程语言complete a written homework assignment (HW) for some   of these texts   to   help   you   prepare for   class
discussion. You will submit your homework assignments as either   Microsoft Word,   PDF   documents   or   cut      and   pasted text   into Canvas.   Please don’t   use Apple’s “pages,” since   Canvas   is   not   compatible with   pages.   Readings and   reading activities are due on the   posted date   on   Canvas.
These assignments may   involve:
●         Creating a double entry journal
●         Writing   up a   Q    A
●            Annotating a   Text
●            Outlining an Article
These written out-of-class reading assignments and exercises comprise   a   large   portion   of your   grade. The exercises are due at the   posted date and   time.   Please   note   Canvas   automatically   assigns   a   50%   deduction the   minute after the due time has elapsed.   Email   submissions   of   homework   or essays   will   not   earn credit until they are   submitted   to   Canvas.
4.                              Discussion   Board   posts
On occasion, students will post responses to   course   readings   on the   discussion   board forums,   which   will   count towards your participation credit. These discussion   board   posts will   include one   initial   300 word post, followed   by two   100+ word   paragraphs   based upon your response to your colleagues’   initial   post.
5.                            Class Attendance and   Meaningful   Participation
In accordance with   Irvine Valley College   policies, students   may   be dropped from a   course   if they   miss   six   or more   instructional   hours during the term before   November   18, 2024. A   student   can   be   absent three      sessions   before   November   18 without   penalty.   If the student   incurs four absences on or before   November   18, the student may be dropped from   the   course.
Students who are still officially enrolled past the withdrawal   deadline   (65%   point/Drop with   a   “W”   Grade) and who   have   been excessively absent   per the attendance   policy   may be assigned   a   Failing Withdrawal (FW) grade. The   FW counts the same as a   F   grade   in   the   grade   point   average,   but   denotes   you   stopped   attending class and did   not fail due to   lack of   mastery   of the   course   material. The   FW   grade   may   impact         eligibility for some types of financial aid. See the   Financial Aid Office for   more   information.   If you   are   an international student,   this   may affect your status. See   International Student   Office.
If you choose to stop attending class,   please complete the drop   process   on   your   own.   If you   accumulate   more than three absences for the semester after the final drop date   (11.18.24),   you will   not   have   earned   enough   participation credit, and your final grade will be affected.   If you   are   absent,   please   contact   another student to find out what you missed.   I suggest you   exchange   phone   numbers   and/or email   addresses with another reliable student in class   for   this   purpose.
Since the completion of much of the writing projects   hinges   upon   class activities,   excessive   absences   will   prevent you from   passing the class. Additionally,   please   note that course announcements   regarding class   business or grades often   happen at the top of the   hour. Also,   pop quizzes   often   take   place   immediately when class   begins, and these quizzes cannot   be   made up   if students   are   tardy,   so   missing   the   first   few   minutes of class can   have large consequences. That   being said,   I   would   suggest   striving   to   arrive   on   time,   since   it   is one of the   ways students demonstrate respect and   consideration for   each   other   and   for   me.
For clarity, the tardy   policy will   be enforced as follows.   For example,   if the class   begins   at   12:30,   then   12:31 or anytime after is   considered   tardy.
As you can see,   it’s   best to come to class   regularly   and   on time.   If,   however,   you   feel   sick   (especially   if   you test   positive for Covid), the   best thing to do   is to stay   home and   get   the   notes   from   a   colleague.   If there   is work due that day,   please contact   me, and we will figure out   a   make-up   solution.
ZOOM   PRACTICES:   If we   need to   meet via Zoom for pandemic-related reasons, the cultural   expectation   in our course   is to   be visible via webcam to me and your   colleagues.   If   our   class   meets via Zoom, we will   be   using the class.com software, which enhances the Zoom experience.   I   will   let you   know   if and when this   is   necessary.    For clarification,   I am   requesting that   you   have   your camera on because studies show that students are   more   successful   when   they   are   actively   engaged   and   visibly present to their professors and colleagues. Therefore,   you   will   need   a   webcam   to   show   attendance. Additionally,   my suggestion   is to use the virtual background feature   in   Zoom.   If you   have   psychological or physical   reasons that   make   it difficult to   meet this   requirement, then   it   is   necessary for   you to schedule an individual appointment   with   me so that we   can   brainstorm   solutions   together.
Furthermore, students earn points by attending   the   zoom   meetings   and   completing written   class work   that   is submitted on Canvas, when assigned. As a   policy, students   cannot   earn full   credit   for   class work   when they are absent from zoom sessions, since no   make   up   class work will   be   accepted   when   students   are   absent, similar to   policy   in on-campus face-to-face classes.   I   recognize,   however, that these are   unusual times, so   if circumstances are unusually dire, feel free to   keep   me   in the   loop,   and   I’ll   consider   situations         on a case   by case   basis. As a   rule,   keep   in   mind that zoom attendance   and   engagement   is   mandatory   for   meaningful class participation and to   earn   credit.
LATE   POLICY:   If something   unexpected   prevents you from   submitting an essay on time, there   is   a   grace   policy. Only one out of the two out-of-class writing   projects   can   be turned   in   up   to   24   hours   past   the   due date and time without   penalty.   Please alert   me   if you   need to   use this clause.   I suggest saving   it   for when   you   really   need to   use   it.
OPTIONAL   EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES: There are at least   three   opportunities   to   earn   extra   credit throughout the semester.
●          Revise either WP #1   or WP #3   =      5   essay   percentage   points   on   essay   1
●          Complete an extended   metacognitive   analysis   of WP #3   assessment   = 20   HW   points
●          Earn   no   more than   1   tardy throughout   the   semester   =   10   essay   percentage   points   on   essay   #2
CONDITIONALLY   RELEASED ASSIGNMENTS: Throughout the course, there may be   some   required conditionally released assignments. A conditionally released assignment   is   one   in which   a   piece   of the content or an assignment does   not   become available until   the   student   meets   a   specific   condition.   For   instance,   if an   instructor wants to ensure that students read a specific   document   before   students   complete   an assignment,   instructors can   place a condition on the assignment   that   requires   students   to   view   a   Canvas page containing the document. After the student views the   page, the   graded   assignment   will   unlock   itself, and the student can complete   it   and   earn   points.
To earn credit,   make sure to complete the conditionally   released   assignments   by   the   specified   due   date         and time to ensure you can move on   and   complete   the   next   assignments   in   the   sequence.   Students who   skip assignments   in the required sequence cannot earn   credit for the   following   assignment,   so   be   sure   to   complete each one on   schedule.

Grade appeals for essays and exams must   be submitted   in writing,   explaining   why   a   particular   grade   should   be changed on the   basis of the essay or exam’s   merit.   If the   instructor consents   to   re-evaluate   the   text, then the second results   of the evaluation are final,   and   the   score   may   increase,   decrease,   or   earn the same amount   of   points.
